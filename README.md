## Research Question

The aim of this project is to predict the housing prices based on a hystorical, given, data and to quantify the relationship between the indicators. On the end, we want to establish how accurate is our statistical regression model. 

### Abstract

For the purpose of this study we have used the Boston housing dataset. This dataset contains the data about different 
- opportunity (what data do we have)
- challenge (what is the "problem" we could solve with this dataset)
- action (how will we try to solve this problem/answer this question)
- resolution (what did we end up producing)

### Introduction

Brief (no more than 1-2 paragraph) description about the dataset. Can copy from elsewhere, but cite the source (i.e. at least link, and explicitly say if it's copied from elsewhere).

There are 14 attributes in each case of the dataset. They are:
01. CRIM - per capita crime rate by town
02. ZN - proportion of residential land zoned for lots over 25,000 sq.ft.
03. INDUS - proportion of non-retail business acres per town.
04. CHAS - Charles River dummy variable (1 if tract bounds river; 0 otherwise)
05. NOX - nitric oxides concentration (parts per 10 million)
06. RM - average number of rooms per dwelling
07. AGE - proportion of owner-occupied units built prior to 1940
08. DIS - weighted distances to five Boston employment centres
09. RAD - index of accessibility to radial highways
10. TAX - full-value property-tax rate per $10,000
11. PTRATIO - pupil-teacher ratio by town
12. B - 1000(Bk - 0.63)^2 where Bk is the proportion of blacks by town
13. LSTAT - % lower status of the population
14. MEDV - Median value of owner-occupied homes in $1000's



### Methods

Brief (no more than 1-2 paragraph) description about how you decided to approach solving it. Include:

- pseudocode for this method (either created by you or cited from somewhere else)
- why you chose this method

### Results

Brief (2 paragraph) description about your results. Include:

- At least 1 figure
- At least 1 "value" that summarizes either your data or the "performance" of your method
- A short explanation of both of the above

### Discussion
Brief (no more than 1-2 paragraph) description about what you did. Include:

- interpretation of whether your method "solved" the problem
- suggested next step that could make it better.
